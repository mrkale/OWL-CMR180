# OWL-CMR180

Owl micro+ Wireless electricity monitor uses Oregon Scientific V3 protocol.

After buying one of those wonderful little devices to study the energy consumed at home, i browsed the internet to find a way to decode frames sent by the transmitter (CMR180) but I have not found any application describing the coding system of the information in the radio frames. So I decided to study the radio packets to decode the system.

Code available for Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
